# Agenda
- Think of research questions (likely to do with either the MICB 475 parkisons datasets or maxines newly approved dataset)
    - Gastric Cancer and Parkinsons connection (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7950232/#r6)
    - Found another dataset : Gut microbiome dysbiosis across early Parkinson’s disease, REM sleep behavior disorder and their first-degree relatives
(https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10154387/#notes3)
- Discuss the best research question for our project
- Outline next steps for individuals once our research question has been confirmed

#### Barcode paper ####
- determined 15 DEGs between gastric cancer (GC) and Parkinson's disease (PD)
- 3 gene ontology (GO) biological process terms common
  - Positive regulation of proteasomal ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process
  - Myeloid cell differentiation
  - Leukocyte differentiation

#### Potential Research Question ####
How does gut microbiome composition and diet‑related microbial dysbiosis modulate the expression of differentially expressed genes and the shared gene‑ontology biological processes that are common between Parkinson’s disease and gastric cancer?


### Meeting Notes ###
- we found a paper that showed a potential link between gene expressions to analyze the comparison between the gut microbiome of in Parkinson's and Gastric Conditions
- we want to profile parkinsons, gastric cancer, and healthy patients
- Another Idea: could potentially also look at patients with higher BMI and REM sleep in Parkinson's patients

# Agenda
- Have datasets at least imported by the meeting, hopefully until denoise/clustering step
- Ask Ritu about sampling depth for Parkinsons data
- Ask Ritu about trimming for GC data
- Discuss proposal
  - Particularly, why our research?

### Meeting Minutes ###

Proposal:
Have an -ing verb as the first word for the title
Background: look at studies on gastritis, gastric ulcers,  and parkinsons, (ie. compare with other gastritis conditions and their microbiomes, identify the overlap)
Find studies with correlation between gut-related things and parkinsons
Based on these studies, discuss hypothesis and research question
Mention that x and y papers found H. pylori in common
Discuss the significance of this research and potential impacts
Research question: one sentence in bold
Ensure to base hypotheses on papers 

Keep looking deeper into papers that go over gastric cancer and parkinsons separately and find overlap to explain hypothesis (base directly off studies, not just a guess)

Aims: should be full sentences, mention the specific diversity metrics you are planning to use and what statistical tests you want to use (what are their names)

Dataset overview: 
In first 1-2 paragraphs: discuss datasets (ie. details like age - should be some overlap between datasets), add sufficient details
Mention age groups 
Our hypothesis: there is more specific bacteria that overlap between parkinsons and GC (ie. there are more similarities than we realized)
Keep a formal tone (not conversational)


*** Ritu will get back to us about the demux file and sampling depth
